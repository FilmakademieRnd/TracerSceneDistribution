## How to install the TRACER Add-On for Blender
There are two ways to proceed depending on whether you want to dowlnoad the whole repo or you are just interested in the TRACER Add-On and you want to get straight to the point.
### Download the dedicated TRACER Add-On for Blender Release archive
In the Realeses section, a zip archive of TRECER Add-On for Blender is made available for download. Having downloaded it, it can be installed by going to Edit > Preferences > Add-Ons in Blender, clicking on the "Install" button, and selecting the zip file of the TRACER Add-On wherever it has been saved on your computer.
Don't forget to enable it, by cheching the box next to it and you're all set up! 
### Download or clone the repository 
If you want to have the whole repository on your machine, for playing around with it a bit more, you can either simply zip the Blender folder in the repo and install it as detailed above, or bind your favourite text editor to blender in order to modify the Add-On and extend its functionalities.

[//]: # (Looking for a better solution to connect repo and blender, so that when someone pulls from github blenders sees the updated version of the add-on)

## Requirements
The Add-On is developed for and tested on Blender 4.1.1, on previous versions some function calls return errors because of a change in the internal blender API. It should be compatible with blender 4.2, at least as far as we know.

In order to exploit the full set of functionalities of [TRACER](https://github.com/FilmakademieRnd/TRACER) (insert link), an up-to-date version of [DataHub](https://github.com/FilmakademieRnd/DataHub) is needed, [AnimHost](https://github.com/FilmakademieRnd/AnimHost) and other clients (like [VPET](https://github.com/FilmakademieRnd/VPET)) integrate in the same TRACER framework and can enhance the capabilities of this Add-On.
