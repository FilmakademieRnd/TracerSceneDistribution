TRACER Scene Distribution Plugin Blender is a development by Filmakademie
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Animationsinstitut R&D Labs in the scope of the EU funded
project MAX-R (101070072) and funding on the own behalf of Filmakademie
Baden-Wuerttemberg.  Former EU projects Dreamspace (610005) and SAUCE (780470)
have inspired the TRACER Scene Distribution Plugin Blender development.
